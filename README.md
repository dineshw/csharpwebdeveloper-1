A simple contextual project to help the team access your brilliance. The solution is designed to help us get a quick insight into what you love about bulding great software.

## The scenario

We recently acquired a new customer in the Acme Zoo. They had a very interesting request. They asked us to build an animal library that they could plug into an existing system.
The library is required for the creation of animals in the larger system.
Example
```
var dog = Zoo.AnimalMaker.Make("Dog");
```

Given all their systems are running in .Net they have decided it makes sense to create a simple library they can reuse throughout their stack.

### The libray should.

* Create animals.
* Comply to reasonable software development practices.
* Be testable in isolation.
* The solution must be buidable and testable using [Rake](http://rake.rubyforge.org/) as this is the customers preferred CI task toolset.
* Be totally portable, if we cannot suck it down and build it from the command line dont bother.

### What will your future team mates be looking for in your response.
* Simple yet innovative improvements.
* Refactoring for the better.
* Attempts to improve quality of the existing code base.
* Tidy code.
* A sound understanding of efficient developer workflow or TDD.
* Improved documentation, be it commented code or valuable test suite.

### What next?
* Please fork or clone the repo and make any changes.
* Once you are done please reply to the email that sent you here with a link to your repo on GitHub.
* Do not email the solution back, create a repo and we will clone it.
* Have fun!!

### In closing.

No tricks, no monkey business. A plain and transparent exercise that we believe you should enjoy completing.
