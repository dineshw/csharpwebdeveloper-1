# csharpwebdeveloper

A simple contextual project to help the team access your brilliance. The solution is designed to help us get a quick insight into what you love about bulding great software.

## The scenario

We recently acquired a new customer in the Acme Zoo. They had a very interesting request. They asked us to build an animal library that they could plug into an existing system.

### The libray should.

* Create animals.
* Comply to reasonable software development practices.
* Be testable in isolation.
* The solution must be buidable and testable using [Rake](http://rake.rubyforge.org/) as this is the customers preferred CI task toolset.
* Be totally portable, if we cannot suck it down and build it from the command line dont bother.

### What next?
* Please fork or clone the repo and make any changes.
* Once you are done please reply to the email that sent you here with a link to your repo on GitHub.
* Do not email the solution back, create a repo and we will clone it.
* Have fun!!

### In closing.

No tricks, no monkey business. A plain and transparent exercise that we believe you should enjoy completing.
